## Description
This project uses the Iris data that comes with R.  
It prompts the user to specif which info they are interested in Petal, Septal, or both.    
- If the user chooses Petal, it shows the plot that has Petal length in the X axis and Petal width in the Y axis.  
- If the user chooses Sepal, it shows the plot of Sepal length in the X axis and Sepal width in the Y axis.  
- If the user chooses Both, it shows a matrix of scatterplots.  The column name shown in each row is displayed in the X axis and the other columns are shown in the Y axis.  
There are three types of Iris: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.  Each species is represented by a different color.


The other part of the project is to prompt the user to guess which species of Iris has the shortest average Petal length.  
The user is shown a pulldown box with the three types of Iris with "Setosa" displayed at the top.    
Once the user makes a selection and clicks on the Submit button, the feedback is shown on the righthand side below the plot.  
**It is important that the user clicks on the Submit button once the selection is made.**  
If the answer is incorrect, the user is encouraged to try again.  
When the user chooses the correct selection of "Sesota", the positive feedback is given with the average Petal length.
